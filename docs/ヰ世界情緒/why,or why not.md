# why,or why not
---
<lyric>
To get my happiness I had done everything,<br/>
but had done nothing to be blamed and accused of.<br/>
The sound of footsteps became louder every day,<br/>
Then I noticed the fact there was no time.<br/>
<br/>
I was a believer in life to be myself always,<br/>
and was asking whether I would be alive.<br/>
<br/>
Give me a reason why not to adopt in this way,<br/>
or judge me to be guilty of so many incurable sins.<br/>
Tell me why, or why not. Complaining way too much,<br/>
maybe I overlooked something fatal for me.<br/>
<br/>
The whole world was at a complete standstill,<br/>
and I was in fetters at the mercy of the mob.<br/>
The silent warning became louder every day.<br/>
Then I kept pretending not to hear.<br/>
<br/>
Its meaning had been in the eyes of beholder all along.<br/>
It had grown dark before I found a sign.<br/>
<br/>
"Among the nonsense tragedies,<br/>
what on earth you are looking for?<br/>
You only have to be honest to yourself and your own fate."<br/>
Tell me why, or why not. Complaining way too much,<br/>
maybe I overlooked something fatal for me.<br/>
<br/>
There is nobody who knows there will be nobody.<br/>
Except for me, all the world has gone mad.<br/>
<br/>
So what is forgiveness you are willing to withhold?<br/>
What is the well-being you are willing to make?<br/>
Now what? So what? Don't you come interrupt me, oh please,<br/>
while I am interrupting myself.<br/>
